# AI Approach for Unity Child Transform Tool

This document outlines the step-by-step approach taken to create and prepare the Unity Child Transform Tool for development, testing, and Unity Package Manager (UPM) compatibility. It is designed to guide both humans and AI agents in continuing the workflow.

---

## Step 1: Initial Setup
1. **Define Project Structure**:
   - Created a `Dev` folder for development artifacts (e.g., shell scripts, configs).
   - Created a `Packages/com.glen-martin-tvmsi.unitychildtransformtool` folder for UPM-compatible files.
   - Ensured proper folder hierarchy:
     ```
     unity-child-transform-tool/
     ├── Packages/
     │   └── com.glen-martin-tvmsi.unitychildtransformtool/
     │       ├── Editor/
     │       ├── Tests/Editor/
     │       ├── package.json
     │       ├── LICENSE
     │       └── README.md
     ├── Dev/
     │   ├── setup_project.sh
     │   ├── create_tests.sh
     │   └── other development scripts...
     ```

2. **Generate `.meta` Files**:
   - Used a script to generate `.meta` files for all assets in the `Packages` folder to ensure Unity recognizes them.

3. **Setup Git Repository**:
   - Configured Git with proper `.gitignore` rules to exclude unnecessary files like `Library/`, `Temp/`, and `Dev/`.

---

## Step 2: Development Workflow
1. **Scripts for Automation**:
   - Created `setup_project.sh` to initialize the project structure.
   - Created `create_tests.sh` to generate test scripts in the appropriate folder.

2. **Testing**:
   - Added test scripts under `Packages/com.glen-martin-tvmsi.unitychildtransformtool/Tests/Editor`.
   - Used Unity's Test Runner to validate functionality.

3. **Versioning**:
   - Followed Semantic Versioning (e.g., `0.4.0`) in `package.json`.

---

## Step 3: UPM Compatibility
1. **Package Metadata**:
   - Added a valid `package.json` file with metadata required by Unity Package Manager.
   - Ensured all necessary files (e.g., scripts, tests, README) were included in the package.

2. **Exclude Development Artifacts**:
   - Moved all development-related files (e.g., shell scripts, configs) to the `Dev/` folder.
   - Excluded the `Dev/` folder using `.gitignore`.

3. **GitHub Integration**:
   - Pushed the cleaned repository to GitHub.
   - Verified that the package could be imported into Unity using its Git URL.

---

## Step 4: Future Workflow
1. **For Humans**:
   - Use the `setup_project.sh` script to initialize new projects or restructure existing ones.
   - Use the `create_tests.sh` script to add new tests as needed.
   - Run tests using Unity's Test Runner.

2. **For AI Agents**:
   - Follow this document to understand the project structure and workflows.
   - Use automation scripts (`setup_project.sh`, `create_tests.sh`) as starting points for further enhancements.

## Key Notes
- The project is now fully compatible with Unity Package Manager.
- Development artifacts are separated from production files.
- The workflow is designed to be easily extensible by both humans and AI agents.
